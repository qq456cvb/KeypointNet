# KeypointNet

**Full dataset is available now!** KeypointNet is a large-scale and diverse 3D keypoint dataset that contains
83,231 keypoints and 8,329 3D models from 16 object categories, by leveraging numerous human annotations, based on ShapeNet models. Our paper is available on https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.12687.pdf and is accepted to CVPR 2020. **You can explore our dataset on <a href="http://qq456cvb.github.io/keypointnet/explore/" target="_blank">http://qq456cvb.github.io/keypointnet/explore/</a>**.

**News! Two interesting unsupervised keypoint detectors: [UKPGAN](https://github.com/qq456cvb/UKPGAN) (unordered but SE(3) invariant) and [SkeletonMerger](https://github.com/eliphatfs/SkeletonMerger) (not SE(3) invariant but ordered) are now released!**

# Keypoint Data
Dataset can be downloaded from <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_d1TzZEF25Wy5kRj5ZugrgGeyf7xxu8F?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Google Drive</a>  or <a href="https://1drv.ms/u/s!Aj0NuSsDz6hDyF3LT3xaPkXK9DXC?e=kcrfSg" target="_blank">OneDrive</a>. Annotated JSON data is placed under **annotations**. In addition, we provide sampled point clouds (2048 points) for each ShapeNet model under **pcds**.

We have processed and cleaned labels for airplane (1022 models), bathtub (492 models), bed (146 models), bottle (380 models), cap (38 models), car (1002 models), chair (999 models), guitar (697 models), helmet (90 models), knife (270 models), laptop (439 models), motorcycle (298 models), mug (198 models), skateboard (141 models), table (1124 models) and vessel (910 models).

**UPDATE:** we have managed to add **color** information onto sampled point clouds and keypoints. In addition, since processing raw ShapeNet obj file as colored triangle meshes is painful, we have generated corresponding ply files (named **ShapeNetCore.v2.ply.zip**) with vertex colors (diffuse texture color), for those are interested in dealing with triangle meshes. We believe color is an important source when learning from 3D geometries.
